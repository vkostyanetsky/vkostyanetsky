## Hi there 👋

I'm Vlad — a business software developer specializing in 1C:Enterprise (I'm a certified 1C:Enterprise expert, to be certain) and experimenting with everything else. A lot.

Currently, I'm working on [FirstBIT ERP](https://firstbit.ae/). It is a company management system (sales, purchasing, production, human resources etc.) designed for the United Arab Emirates.

I also secretly have a passion for cycling and video games.
