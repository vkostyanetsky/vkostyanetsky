### Hi there üëã

My name is Vlad. I'm a business software developer based in Kemerovo, Russia. I'm a certified 1C:Enterprise expert, which experiments with everything else. A lot.

I'm currently working on FirstBIT ERP. It is a company management system (sales, purchasing, production, human resources etc.) designed for the United Arab Emirates.

I also secretly have a passion for cycling and video games.
